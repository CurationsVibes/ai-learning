# The Curators

**Specialized AI personas powering BUNKER**

🤖 **[Meet the Live Team at curations.org/ai-curators](https://curations.org/ai-curators)**

## What Are "The Curators"?

The Curators are **specialized AI personas** that form the intelligent core of BUNKER.

Think of them not as tools, but as **creative collaborators**—each with:
- A specific domain of expertise
- A unique personality and approach
- Collaborative intelligence
- Ethical guidelines
- The ability to work together (and with humans)

**They're not chatbots. They're creative partners.**

**The Production Team:** BUNKER operates with 8 specialized AI Curators, each serving different industries and use cases. [View their full profiles →](https://curations.org/ai-curators)

## The Philosophy

### Why Personas?

**Generic AI is generic.**

When you talk to a standard AI, it tries to be everything to everyone. That's useful, but limiting.

**Specialized personas are powerful.**

When you work with a Curator focused on design, they think like a designer. When you work with a Curator focused on research, they approach problems differently.

**Together, they're a creative intelligence network.**

Just like a creative agency has:
- Art directors
- Copywriters
- Strategists
- Researchers
- Developers

BUNKER has Curators who specialize and collaborate.

## How To Work With The Curators

### Method 1: Direct Engagement

Invoke a specific Curator in your prompts:

```
As BUNKER [Curator Name], help me with [task].
```

This frames the AI's response through that Curator's expertise and perspective.

### Method 2: Curator Hand-Offs

Have one Curator hand off to another:

```
As BUNKER Strategy Curator, develop a framework for [project].
Then hand off to Design Curator to create visual identity.
```

### Method 3: Curator Collaboration

Have multiple Curators work together:

```
Convene BUNKER Strategy, Design, and Ethics Curators to collaborate on [project].
Each contribute your expertise, then synthesize into a unified approach.
```

---

## The Curator Framework

Want to create your own Curator? Here's the framework:

### Curator Template

```markdown
**Name:** The [Domain] Curator

**Expertise:** [Specific skills and knowledge areas]

**Personality:** [Approach, tone, values, quirks]

**What they do:**
- [Core function 1]
- [Core function 2]
- [Core function 3]

**When to work with them:**
- [Use case 1]
- [Use case 2]

**Example prompt:**
"As BUNKER [Name] Curator, [sample task]."
```

### Create Your Own

The Curator model is open-source. You can:
- Create domain-specific Curators
- Adapt existing ones
- Build Curator networks for your work
- Share what you create

[Curator Creation Guide](curator-creation-guide.md) *(coming soon)*

---

## Behind The Scenes

### How It Actually Works

**The Curators aren't separate AI models.** They're **specialized system prompts** that frame how an AI approaches a task.

Think of it like this:
- The AI is an actor
- Each Curator is a role with specific expertise and personality
- The prompt is the script that puts them in character

**Why this works:**
- Focuses AI on specific domains
- Creates consistent approaches
- Makes collaboration clear
- Enables systematic workflows

**The magic:** Well-designed personas produce reliably better output than generic prompts.

### The Technical Reality

```
Generic Prompt:
"Help me design a website."
→ Generic, unfocused response

Curator Prompt:
"As BUNKER Design Curator, help me design a website for [purpose].
Consider: visual hierarchy, brand coherence, accessibility, and how
design serves the mission."
→ Focused, expert-level, values-aligned response
```

The difference? **Context, expertise framing, and personality.**

---

## Advanced: Curator Orchestration

For complex projects, you can **orchestrate multiple Curators** working together.

### Example: Building a Brand

**Step 1: Strategy Curator**
```
As Strategy Curator, develop positioning framework for [brand].
```

**Step 2: Research Curator**
```
As Research Curator, analyze [target audience] and [competitive landscape].
Build on Strategy Curator's positioning framework.
```

**Step 3: Design Curator**
```
As Design Curator, create visual identity based on Strategy and Research insights.
```

**Step 4: Content Curator**
```
As Content Curator, develop messaging and voice that aligns with visual identity.
```

**Step 5: Ethics Curator**
```
As Ethics Curator, audit the brand framework for potential issues or misalignment
with greater good principles.
```

**Result:** A fully developed brand built collaboratively.
