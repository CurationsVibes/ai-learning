# About CurationsLA

**Hyperlocal LA media. Human-curated. AI-supported. Good vibes only.**

---

## What Is CurationsLA?

CurationsLA is a **hyperlocal Los Angeles media platform** that tells the stories of LA's neighborhoods, people, and culture.

We're not another news site. We're not clickbait. We're not algorithmic noise.

**We're LA, telling LA's story.**

Curated by humans. Supported by AI. Free and ungated. Non-political. Community-first.

---

## Why CurationsLA Exists

### The Problem

Local media is dying. The outlets that remain are:
- Paywalled (inaccessible)
- Clickbait-driven (low quality)
- Corporate-owned (disconnected from community)
- Algorithm-optimized (designed for engagement, not truth)

**LA deserves better.**

### The Solution

**Human-curated local storytelling, amplified by AI.**

CurationsLA is:
- **Free** – No paywall, no subscription, no gatekeeping
- **Human-curated** – Real people finding and sharing real stories
- **AI-supported** – Technology helps us scale without losing quality
- **Community-focused** – We tell the stories that matter to Angelenos
- **Good vibes only** – No politics, no rage-bait, no division
- **Trusted** – Transparent about sources, methods, and AI use
