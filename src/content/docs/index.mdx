## What Is CURATOR HUB?

**CURATOR HUB** is a comprehensive knowledge wiki and learning resource for AI development, maintained by [**CURATIONS**](https://curations.org) — a Human × AI Creative Agency based in Los Angeles.

This is not a company site. It's an **open knowledge panel** — a free, ungated collection of frameworks, guides, and cookbooks that make AI development accessible to everyone. Think of it as a Wikipedia for AI creativity, where human insight meets artificial intelligence.

### Created BY CURATIONS

[**CURATIONS**](https://curations.org) is the agency behind this wiki. We're a Human × AI Creative Agency that builds:

- 🎨 **Design systems** that make brands unforgettable

- 🌟 **Multi-agent systems** with personality and purpose
- 🏙️ **Community platforms** (see [CurationsLA](https://la.curations.cc))
