## What Is VibeHub?

VibeHub is where human creativity and AI capability meet to build things that matter.

We're not a tech company. We're not a consultancy. We're a **creative agency** that believes AI should amplify human potential, not replace it. We build:

- 🎨 **Design systems** that make brands unforgettable
- 🤖 **AI strategies** that actually work for real people
- 📖 **Open learning** resources for everyone
- 🌟 **Multi-agent systems** with personality and purpose
- 🏙️ **Community storytelling** platforms (like CurationsLA)
- 🌱 **Youth empowerment** programs (Youth Curator Movement)

**Our philosophy:** Greater good creativity. Every project, every framework, every line of code asks: *Does this make the world better?*

## The Three Branches

VibeHub operates through three interconnected initiatives:

### 1. **VibeHub** (The Creative Agency)
Human × AI collaboration for design, content, research, and AI strategy. We work with brands, communities, and creators to build things that matter.

🌐 **[vibehub.org](https://curations.org)**

### 2. **CurationsLA** (Hyperlocal Media)
A sister project demonstrating Human × AI collaboration in action. CurationsLA is a **hyperlocal LA media platform** that's free, community-focused, and built on good vibes.

🏙️ **[la.curations.cc](https://la.curations.cc)**

### 3. **Youth Curator Movement** (Educational Empowerment)
A mission-driven initiative to empower young people with AI literacy, creativity, and digital wellbeing.

**100% free. 100% open-source. 100% focused on empowerment.**

## Our Values

- ✅ **Open Learning** - All tools, guides, frameworks, and playbooks are free and ungated
