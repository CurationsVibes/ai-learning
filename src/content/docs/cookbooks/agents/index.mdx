## 🔧 What You'll Build

### 🛠️ Foundation: Agent Development Kits (ADK)

Before building agents, understand the ecosystem:

- **LangChain** — The Swiss Army knife of agent development
- **LlamaIndex** — Data-centric agent architecture
- **AutoGPT/BabyAGI** — Autonomous agent pioneers
- **CrewAI** — Multi-agent role-based systems
- **Semantic Kernel** — Microsoft's enterprise agent framework
- **Custom Implementations** — When frameworks aren't enough

→ [Start with ADK Overview](./01-adk-overview/)

---

### 🔄 Agent Types & Architectures

Different problems require different agent architectures:

| Architecture | Pattern | Best For |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Sequential** | A → B → C | Linear workflows, pipelines |
| **Parallel** | A + B + C | Independent subtasks, speed |
| **Loop** | A → B → A... | Iteration, refinement |
| **Hierarchical** | Manager → Workers | Complex delegation |
| **Reactive** | Event → Response | Real-time systems |
| **Hybrid** | Custom composition | Complex workflows |

→ [Master Agent Types](./02-agent-types/)

---

### 📋 Agent Models & Contracts

Production agents need clear interfaces:

```python
# Example Agent Contract
class AgentContract:
    """Define what an agent can do and how to interact with it."""
    
    name: str                    # Unique identifier
    description: str             # What this agent does
    input_schema: Schema         # Expected input format
    output_schema: Schema        # Guaranteed output format
    tools: list[Tool]            # Available capabilities
    max_iterations: int          # Safety limit
    timeout_seconds: float       # Maximum execution time
```

→ [Design Agent Contracts](./03-agent-models/)

---

### 🧬 Defining LLM Agents

The core of agent development — from concept to code:

```python
# Simplified Agent Definition
from langchain.agents import Agent, Tool

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    goal="Find accurate information on any topic",
    tools=[
        Tool(name="search", func=web_search),
        Tool(name="read", func=read_webpage),
        Tool(name="summarize", func=summarize_text)
    ],
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

# The agent can now autonomously research any topic
result = researcher.run("What are the latest advances in AI agents?")
```

## 💡 Key Insights

:::tip[The Agent Mindset Shift]
Agents aren't chatbots with extra steps. They're autonomous systems that plan, execute, observe, and adapt. The key shift is from "prompt engineering" to "goal engineering" — you define objectives, not steps.
:::

:::note[Start Simple, Scale Carefully]
The most common mistake is over-engineering. Start with a simple sequential agent. Add complexity only when you've validated the simple version works. Multi-agent systems are powerful but dramatically harder to debug.
:::

:::caution[Cost Awareness]
Agents can run up significant LLM costs through iteration loops. Always implement:
- Maximum iteration limits
- Timeout boundaries
- Cost monitoring
- Graceful degradation

## ⚡ Quick Wins

Get started immediately with these copy-paste examples:

### Minimal Research Agent

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def simple_agent(task: str) -> str:
    """Minimal viable agent using GPT-4."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": """You are a research agent. 
            For any task:
            1. Break it into steps
            2. Think through each step
            3. Provide a comprehensive answer"""},
            {"role": "user", "content": task}
        ]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage
result = simple_agent("Explain the key differences between LangChain and LlamaIndex")
```

### Tool-Using Agent (LangChain)

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

# Define tools
search = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search.run,
        description="Useful for searching the web for current information"
    )
]

# Create agent
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    OpenAI(temperature=0),
    agent="zero-shot-react-description",
    verbose=True
)

# Run agent
agent.run("What is the current price of Bitcoin?")
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need expensive GPT-4 for agents?</strong></summary>

Not necessarily. Start with GPT-3.5-turbo for development and testing (10x cheaper). Use GPT-4 for production where reasoning quality matters. For cost-sensitive applications, explore open-source models via Ollama or together.ai.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I prevent agents from running forever?</strong></summary>

Implement three safeguards: (1) Maximum iteration count, (2) Timeout limits, (3) Cost caps. Most frameworks support these out of the box. Our guides cover implementation in detail.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can agents access the internet safely?</strong></summary>

Yes, with proper sandboxing. Never give agents unrestricted system access. Use tool abstractions that limit scope. Our Tool Ecosystems guide covers safe patterns for web access.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the difference between agents and chains?</strong></summary>

Chains are predetermined sequences (A→B→C). Agents decide their own actions based on goals and observations. Chains are predictable but inflexible. Agents are adaptive but harder to control. Use chains when you know the exact workflow; use agents when you know the goal but not the path.
