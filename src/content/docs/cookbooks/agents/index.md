**Building sophisticated AI agent systems**

Welcome to the AI Agents section - your comprehensive guide to building intelligent, autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers the complete lifecycle of AI agent development:

### 🛠️ Agent Development Kits (ADK)
Understand the toolkit fundamentals and frameworks that power modern agent development. Learn about the building blocks that make agent creation accessible.

### 🔄 Agent Types
Explore different agent architectures including Sequential, Parallel, Loop, and Custom agents. Each type solves specific problems and has unique strengths.

### 📋 Agent Models & Contracts
Master API design patterns and contracts that enable robust agent communication. Learn how to define clear interfaces between agents and systems.

### 🧬 Defining LLM Agents
Step-by-step guidance on creating your own LLM-powered agents from scratch. Turn concepts into working code.

## Learning Path

Follow these guides sequentially for the best learning experience:

1. **[Agent Development Kits (ADK)](./01-adk-overview/)** - Foundation toolkit concepts
2. **[Agent Types](./02-agent-types/)** - Sequential, Parallel, Loop, and Custom patterns
3. **[Agent Models & Contracts](./03-agent-models/)** - API design and communication
4. **[Defining LLM Agents](./04-defining-llm-agents/)** - Build your first agent
