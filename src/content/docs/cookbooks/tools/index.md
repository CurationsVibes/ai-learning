**Connecting AI agents to the world**

Welcome to the Tools & Ecosystems section - your guide to the protocols, frameworks, and platforms that enable AI agents to interact with systems, data, and other agents.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers the essential tools and standards for agent integration:

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Learn about standardized content delivery for AI systems. MCP enables agents to access context from various sources in a uniform way.

### 🤝 Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)
Master inter-agent communication. A2A allows agents to collaborate, share information, and coordinate actions across systems.

### 🧰 Tool Ecosystems
Explore popular frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI. Understand when to use each tool and how they complement each other.

### 🚀 AI Agent Engines
Discover production deployment platforms and engines. Learn how to scale agents from prototype to production.

## Learning Path
