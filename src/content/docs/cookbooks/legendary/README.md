**Production-grade AI systems at scale**

Welcome to the Legendary Topics section — where theoretical knowledge becomes production-ready systems. These frameworks cover the complete journey from local development to legendary-scale deployment.

## 🌳 What Makes These Topics "Legendary"?

These aren't beginner tutorials. They're battle-tested patterns for:
- Building full-stack AI applications
- Deploying to production with confidence  
- Scaling from MVP to millions of users
- Shaping the future of Human × AI collaboration

## 📖 Topics

## 🎯 Who This Is For

**You're ready for Legendary Topics if you:**
- ✅ Have built and deployed AI prototypes
- ✅ Understand foundational concepts (RAG, agents, prompting)
- ✅ Need production-grade patterns, not tutorials
- ✅ Want to scale systems to serve real users at scale

**Not quite there yet?** Start with:
- [Foundations](../foundations/) - Core AI development concepts
- [RAG Fundamentals](../rag/) - Retrieval augmented generation
- [AI Agents](../agents/) - Agent patterns and architectures

## 💡 Philosophy

These patterns follow HUB's **Greater Good Creativity** principle:
- Build systems that serve communities, not just metrics
- Prioritize human wellbeing alongside technical excellence
- Make AI accessible, not exploitative
- Document openly so others can learn
