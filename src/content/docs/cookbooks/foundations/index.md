# 🌱 Foundations

**Essential building blocks for AI agent development**

Welcome to the Foundations section - your starting point for understanding modern AI agent development. These guides cover the core concepts that every AI developer needs to master.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers three fundamental pillars of AI agent development:

### 🔌 Interoperability
Learn how AI agents communicate using standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent). Understanding interoperability is crucial for building agents that work seamlessly across different platforms and services.

### 🌐 Model Garden
Discover the landscape of foundation models and learn how to select, deploy, and switch between different AI models. The Model Garden approach gives you flexibility and prevents vendor lock-in.

### 🧠 Memory Management
Master the art of building context-aware agents that remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain state across sessions. Memory is what transforms simple AI into intelligent assistants.

## Learning Path

We recommend following these guides in order:

1. **[Introduction to Interoperability](./01-interoperability-intro/)** - Start here to understand how modern AI agents connect and communicate
2. **[Model Garden & Foundation Models](./02-model-garden/)** - Learn about available models and how to work with them
3. **[Memory Management](./03-memory-management/)** - Build agents that remember and learn from context

## 🌱 → 🌿 → 🌳 Progressive Learning

Each guide uses our creative learning labels:
- 🌱 **Seedling** - Beginner-friendly introductions
- 🌿 **Sprout** - Intermediate concepts with code examples
- 🌳 **Forest** - Advanced patterns for production systems
- 💡 **Insight** - Key takeaways and "aha!" moments
- ⚡ **Quick Win** - Fast, actionable implementations
- 🔬 **Deep Dive** - Research and experimental topics

## Who This Is For

**🆕 New to AI?** Start with Introduction to Interoperability - it assumes no prior AI knowledge

**💻 Experienced Developer?** You can jump directly to Memory Management for advanced patterns

**🎨 Building Products?** Focus on Model Garden to understand your options and make informed choices

## Next Steps

Ready to begin? Start with [Introduction to Interoperability](./01-interoperability-intro/) to build your foundation.
