**Essential building blocks for AI agent development**

<UpvoteWidget itemId="foundations-cookbook" itemType="cookbook" />

Welcome to the Foundations section - your starting point for understanding modern AI agent development. These guides cover the core concepts that every AI developer needs to master.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers three fundamental pillars of AI agent development:

### 🔌 Interoperability
Learn how AI agents communicate using standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent). Understanding interoperability is crucial for building agents that work seamlessly across different platforms and services.

### 🌐 Model Garden
Discover the landscape of foundation models and learn how to select, deploy, and switch between different AI models. The Model Garden approach gives you flexibility and prevents vendor lock-in.

### 🧠 Memory Management
Master the art of building context-aware agents that remember conversations, learn from interactions, and maintain state across sessions. Memory is what transforms simple AI into intelligent assistants.
