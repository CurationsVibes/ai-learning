**Grounding AI agents with intelligent retrieval**

Welcome to the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) section - where you'll learn to build AI systems that combine the power of large language models with the precision of knowledge retrieval.

## What You'll Learn

This section takes you from RAG basics to advanced graph-based knowledge systems:

### 📚 RAG Fundamentals
Start with the core concepts of Retrieval Augmented Generation. Learn how to ground AI responses in factual, up-to-date information from your knowledge base.

### 🤖 Agentic RAG
Discover how to add active reasoning to knowledge search. Agentic RAG systems don't just retrieve - they think about what to search for and how to use the results.

### 🕸️ GraphRAG
Master relationship-based knowledge graphs that understand connections between concepts. GraphRAG excels at complex queries that require understanding context and relationships.

### ⚓ Grounding Techniques
Learn advanced strategies for grounding AI responses in reality. Prevent hallucinations and ensure factual accuracy through sophisticated grounding methods.

## Learning Path

Progress through these guides in order:

1. **[RAG Fundamentals](./01-rag-fundamentals/)** - Core concepts and basic implementation
2. **[Agentic RAG](./02-agentic-rag/)** - Adding intelligence to retrieval
3. **[GraphRAG](./03-graph-rag/)** - Relationship-based knowledge systems
4. **[Grounding Techniques](./04-grounding/)** - Advanced accuracy strategies

## 🌱 → 🌿 → 🌳 Progressive Learning

Each guide builds on the previous:
- 🌱 **Seedling** - Simple RAG concepts for beginners
- 🌿 **Sprout** - Working implementations with code
