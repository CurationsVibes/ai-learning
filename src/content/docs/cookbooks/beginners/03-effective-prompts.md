## 🌱 What is a Prompt?

A **prompt** is the question, instruction, or request you give to an AI assistant. Think of it as your half of the conversation - the better your prompt, the better the AI's response.

**Simple Example**:
- ❌ Bad: "Cars"
- ✅ Good: "What are the top 3 most fuel-efficient hybrid cars under $30,000?"

## 🎯 The Elements of Great Prompts

### 1. Be Specific

**Vague**: "Tell me about exercise"  
**Specific**: "Create a 30-minute beginner-friendly home workout routine with no equipment"

### 2. Provide Context

**Without Context**: "Write an email"  
**With Context**: "Write a professional email declining a job offer politely, thanking them for the opportunity"

### 3. State Your Goal

**Unclear Goal**: "Python code"  
**Clear Goal**: "Write Python code to sort a list of names alphabetically and remove duplicates"

### 4. Specify Format

**No Format**: "Information about Paris"  
**With Format**: "Give me 5 bullet points about must-see attractions in Paris, with brief descriptions"
