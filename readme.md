# Welcome to CURATIONS

**A Human × AI Creative Agency built on greater good creativity**

---

## What Is CURATIONS?

CURATIONS is where human creativity and AI capability meet to build things that matter.

We're not a tech company. We're not a consultancy. We're a **creative agency** that believes AI should amplify human potential, not replace it. We build:

- 🎨 **Design systems** that make brands unforgettable
- 🤖 **AI strategies** that actually work for real people
- 📖 **Open learning** resources for everyone
- 🌟 **Multi-agent systems** with personality and purpose
- 🏙️ **Community storytelling** platforms (like CurationsLA)
- 🌱 **Youth empowerment** programs (Youth Curator Movement)

**Our philosophy:** Greater good creativity. Every project, every framework, every line of code asks: *Does this make the world better?*

---

## The Three Branches

CURATIONS operates through three interconnected initiatives:

### 1. **CURATIONS** (The Creative Agency)
Human × AI collaboration for design, content, research, and AI strategy. We work with brands, communities, and creators to build things that matter.

🌐 **[curations.org](https://curations.org)**

**What we do:**
- AI strategy and implementation
- Design systems and brand architecture
- Multi-agent system development
- Content and creative direction
- Open-source framework development

**How we work:**
- Ethical, transparent, community-centered

### 2. **CurationsLA** (Hyperlocal Media)
A sister project demonstrating Human × AI collaboration in action. CurationsLA is a **hyperlocal LA media platform** that's:
- Free and ungated

### 3. **Youth Curator Movement** (Educational Empowerment)
A mission-driven initiative to empower young people with AI literacy, creativity, and digital wellbeing.

**Not a bootcamp. Not a course. A movement.**

We teach youth to:
- Use AI as a creative medium
- Understand emotional and digital safety
- Tell their community's stories
- Become future digital stewards
- Build with purpose, not hype

**100% free. 100% open-source. 100% focused on empowerment.**

## Our Values

### ✅ **Open Learning**
All tools, guides, frameworks, and playbooks are free and ungated. Knowledge should be accessible.

### ✅ **Greater Good Creativity**
Every project asks: Does this make the world better? If not, we don't build it.

### ✅ **Human × AI Partnership**
AI amplifies human creativity. It doesn't replace it. We build systems where both thrive.

### ✅ **Emotional Safety**
AI should support human wellbeing, not manipulate or extract. We prioritize healthy relationships with technology.

### ✅ **Community-Centered**
We serve communities, not corporations. Good vibes, non-political, focused on uplifting people.

### ✅ **Transparency**
How we work, what we build, and why we build it - all documented in the open.

## Hidden Layers

*CURATIONS is built in layers. The more you explore, the more you'll discover.*

*Some things are obvious. Some things are hidden.*

*Keep exploring.* 🗺️

<!--
EASTER EGG LAYER 1: FIRST-TIME AI USER
Hidden prompt for someone who's never used AI before.
This is intentionally in HTML comments so it feels like a discovery.
-->

<!--
🌱 Found the hidden message? Welcome, explorer.

If you've never used AI before, here's your first prompt.
Copy this and paste it into ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) or Claude (claude.ai):

"Help me understand what AI actually is, using only examples from my daily life.
Then tell me one creative thing I could try with AI today."

After you try it, come back here. You're now on the path. 🌟
