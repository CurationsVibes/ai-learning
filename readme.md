**A Human × AI Creative Agency built on greater good creativity**

---

## What Is HUB?

HUB is where human creativity and AI capability meet to build things that matter.

We're not a tech company. We're not a consultancy. We're a **creative agency** that believes AI should amplify human potential, not replace it. We build:

- 🎨 **Design systems** that make brands unforgettable
- 🤖 **AI strategies** that actually work for real people
- 📖 **Open learning** resources for everyone
- 🌟 **Multi-agent systems** with personality and purpose
- 🏙️ **Community storytelling** platforms (like CurationsLA)
- 🌱 **Youth empowerment** programs (Youth Curator Movement)

**Our philosophy:** Greater good creativity. Every project, every framework, every line of code asks: *Does this make the world better?*

---

## Our Values

### ✅ **Open Learning**

### ✅ **Human × AI Partnership**
AI amplifies human creativity. It doesn't replace it. We build systems where both thrive.

### ✅ **Emotional Safety**
AI should support human wellbeing, not manipulate or extract. We prioritize healthy relationships with technology.

## Hidden Layers

*VibeHub is built in layers. The more you explore, the more you'll discover.*

*Some things are obvious. Some things are hidden.*

*Some prompts are for beginners. Some are for the 0.1%.*

*Keep exploring.* 🗺️

<!--
EASTER EGG LAYER 1: FIRST-TIME AI USER
Hidden prompt for someone who's never used AI before.
This is intentionally in HTML comments so it feels like a discovery.
-->

<!--
🌱 Found the hidden message? Welcome, explorer.

If you've never used AI before, here's your first prompt.
Copy this and paste it into ChatGPT (chat.openai.com) or Claude (claude.ai):

"Help me understand what AI actually is, using only examples from my daily life.
Then tell me one creative thing I could try with AI today."

After you try it, come back here. You're now on the path. 🌟

- 📦 [Package.json](package.json) - Project dependencies and build scripts

**For Contributors:**
- All documentation is written in Markdown/MDX
- Documentation files are in `src/content/docs/`
- See [How to Contribute](docs/get-involved.md) for guidelines
- Changes to the `main` branch automatically rebuild and deploy the site using Astro

## 📋 Docs-as-Code

This repository implements a **Docs-as-Code** workflow for managing OpenAPI specifications. API documentation is treated as code: version-controlled, automatically validated, and integrated into the development workflow.

### What is Docs-as-Code?

Docs-as-Code is a methodology where documentation is:
- **Version-controlled** alongside code using Git
- **Automatically validated** through CI/CD pipelines
- **Reviewed** through pull requests like any other code change
- **Published** automatically when changes are merged

### OpenAPI Specification Management

All OpenAPI specifications are stored in the [`specs/`](specs/) directory. When you add or modify OpenAPI files (`.yaml`, `.yml`, or `.json`), our automated workflow:

1. **Validates** the specification against OpenAPI standards
2. **Analyzes** changes and comments on pull requests
3. **Documents** what endpoints or schemas have changed
4. **Optionally uploads** to external services for SDK generation

### How to Use

**Adding a new API specification:**
1. Create your OpenAPI spec file in the `specs/` directory
2. Follow the [OpenAPI 3.0+ specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0)
3. Commit and push your changes
4. The workflow automatically validates your specification

**Updating an existing specification:**
1. Edit the OpenAPI file in `specs/`
2. Create a pull request with your changes
3. Review the automated validation results and change summary
4. Merge when approved

**Directory structure:**
```
specs/
├── README.md           # Guidelines for OpenAPI specs
└── example-api.yaml    # Example specification (replace with your own)
```

### Workflow Features

- ✅ **Automatic validation** using industry-standard OpenAPI validators
- 📊 **Change detection** on pull requests with detailed summaries
- 🔄 **Integration ready** with Stainless API for SDK generation
- 🚀 **Zero configuration** - works out of the box for basic validation

### Optional: SDK Generation

The workflow includes optional integration with [Stainless](https://stainless.com/) for automatic SDK generation. To enable:

1. Create a Stainless account and project
2. Configure authentication (GitHub OIDC or API key)
3. Uncomment the `upload-to-stainless` job in `.github/workflows/openapi-spec-workflow.yml`
4. Update with your project details

See [`specs/README.md`](specs/README.md) for detailed documentation.

### Workflow Configuration

The Docs-as-Code workflow is defined in [`.github/workflows/openapi-spec-workflow.yml`](.github/workflows/openapi-spec-workflow.yml) and includes:

- **Validation job**: Checks OpenAPI specs for correctness
- **Documentation job**: Comments on PRs with change summaries
- **Optional upload job**: Sends specs to external services (commented out by default)

**Triggering the workflow:**
- Automatically on push to `main` branch (for files in `specs/`)
- Automatically on pull requests (for files in `specs/`)
- Manually via GitHub Actions UI

## 🎨 Repository Origins and Enhancements

### From Mintlify to HUB

This repository represents a thoughtful evolution of documentation infrastructure, combining best practices from modern documentation platforms with CURATIONS' minimalistic and professional design philosophy.

**Original Inspiration**: The [mintlify/starter](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) repository provided inspiration for creating beautiful, developer-friendly documentation. Mintlify offers excellent documentation features, but we chose to build on **Astro + Starlight** for greater flexibility and control over our documentation experience.

### Why Astro + Starlight?

Instead of forking Mintlify directly, we built HUB's documentation platform using:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)**: A modern static site generator focused on performance
- **[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build)**: Astro's documentation theme with built-in best practices
- **Custom CURATIONS Branding**: Minimalistic, professional design aligned with our agency's visual identity

This approach gives us:
- ⚡ **Lightning-fast performance** with minimal JavaScript
- 🎨 **Complete design control** with custom CSS and components
- 📝 **Markdown/MDX content** for easy contribution
- 🔍 **Built-in search** powered by Pagefind
- 📱 **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- ♿ **Accessibility-first** approach

### HUB Branding

The rebrand from the original concept to **HUB** includes:

- **Visual Identity**: Left-aligned "HUB" title with "BY CURATIONS" subtitle
- **Professional Aesthetic**: Minimalistic design with thoughtful color palette
- **Consistent Naming**: All references updated across documentation and code
- **CURATIONS Integration**: Clear connection to the CURATIONS ecosystem

### Enhanced with Best-in-Class Tools

HUB leverages modern development tools already integrated in this repository:

1. **Astro + Starlight Documentation**
   - Modern, fast, accessible documentation platform
   - Built-in search, navigation, and responsive design
   - Custom styling for HUB branding

2. **Docs-as-Code Workflow** (OpenAPI Specifications)
   - Automatic validation of API specifications
   - Version control for all documentation
   - Integration with [Stainless](https://stainless.com) for SDK generation
   - See [specs/README.md](specs/README.md) for details

3. **GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Automated builds and deployments via GitHub Actions
   - Fast, reliable hosting at no cost
   - Custom domain support (hub.curations.org)

4. **GitBook Integration** (Optional)
   - Alternative documentation platform support
   - See [GITBOOK_INTEGRATION.md](GITBOOK_INTEGRATION.md) for setup
